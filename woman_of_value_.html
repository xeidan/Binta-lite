            So many women struggle to find their place in the world, to build
            meaningful relationships, and to achieve the success they deserve.
            And yet, they're sold false promises of quick fixes and instant
            solutions, only to be left feeling disappointed, depressed, defeated,
            and still searching for answers.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg md:text-xl font-light pt-6">
            This is something I’ve seen so many women like you struggle with. To
            build a life that truly reflects their worth and value. They long for
            success, for a sense of purpose, and for relationships that nourish
            their soul. But time and time again, they hit the same roadblocks,
            struggling to break free from the limitations that hold them back.
